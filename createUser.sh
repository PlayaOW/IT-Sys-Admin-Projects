# This script creates a user with a home directory, UID, GID, and other details
# It ensures that the username is unique, the UID and GID are valid, and securely stores user details
# It also sets appropriate permissions for the user's home directory and files
# The script uses sudo for commands that require elevated privileges
# It provides feedback to the user throughout the process
# The script is designed to be user-friendly and secure
# It handles errors gracefully and prompts the user for input when necessary
# The script is intended for use on a Linux system with bash shell
